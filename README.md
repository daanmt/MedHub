# MedHub

> Personal study system for Brazilian medical-residency preparation. Closes the loop between a wrong answer, a structured error log, a clinical-summary refinement, and a spaced-repetition card.

**Status:** operational personal project, in active use. Single-user. No external deployment, no auth, no multi-user support.

## What it is

MedHub turns a failed practice question into a durable learning artifact. A single CLI invocation records the error with diagnostic metadata in a local SQLite database, generates a heuristic flashcard, and schedules a card in a simplified FSRS scheduler. A markdown knowledge base (`resumos/`) is then progressively refined through use. A Streamlit app sits on top for review, dashboards, and library browsing.

The knowledge base is local by default — embeddings are computed by Ollama against summaries on disk and stored in a local ChromaDB. The Anthropic API is called only for three optional capabilities (HyDE query expansion, LLM-quality flashcard generation, and agent-memory session consolidation); each gracefully degrades to a local fallback or a heuristic when the key is absent.

Retrieval is multi-query: the raw query and (when enabled) a HyDE-generated hypothetical answer are queried in parallel against a ChromaDB collection of H2/H3-chunked summaries. Results are deduplicated and filtered by a hard cosine-distance threshold (`0.35`). A BM25 hybrid rerank is implemented (`_bm25_rerank` in `app/engine/rag.py`) but disabled in code: re-enabling it regressed retrieval on this corpus.

**No automated retrieval benchmark is committed to this repo.** Internal documents quote informal manual-evaluation numbers; the runner and the fixture queries are not in the repo, so those numbers are not reproducible from this codebase. The RAG layer is described qualitatively here for that reason.

## Stack

- **Language / app:** Python 3.10+, Streamlit (multipage via `st.navigation`)
- **Storage:** SQLite — `ipub.db` for study state, `medhub_memory.db` for agent memory.
- **Retrieval:** ChromaDB persistent client + `nomic-embed-text` via Ollama at `http://localhost:11434`. Chroma collection persisted at `data/chroma/`.
- **LLM (optional):** Anthropic SDK (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`), used in three places: HyDE query expansion (`app/engine/rag.py`), LLM-quality flashcard generation (`app/engine/generate_flashcards.py`), and agent-memory session consolidation (`app/memory/manager.py`, via `langchain-anthropic`). Each call site falls back when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is unset.
- **Reranking:** `rank-bm25` (implemented, disabled — see `rag.py`).
- **Spaced repetition:** FSRS-inspired simplified scheduler (`app/utils/fsrs.py`, ~75 LOC). The 17-weight default vector is the canonical FSRS v4 `DEFAULT_W`, but `evaluate()` applies a single linear difficulty update and one stability formula — not faithful FSRS v4.
- **Agent-memory scaffolding:** LangGraph `SqliteSaver` checkpointer + LangMem-backed store on a separate `medhub_memory.db`. Only `consolidate_session` (triggered by a PostToolUse hook) and two read paths (`weak_areas` in `get_topic_context` and `summarize_performance`) are exercised; the checkpointer and `tools.py` exports are scaffold for an agent that does not live in this repo.
- **PDF extraction:** pdfplumber, PyPDF2 (delete-after-extract policy — `Tools/extract_pdfs.py`).
- **Dashboards:** Plotly, pandas.

```

Of the 5 exports in `app/engine/__init__.py`, only `summarize_performance` (dashboard) and `get_topic_context.search` (library) have in-repo callers. The other three (`analyze_error`, `get_review_queue`, `generate_contextual_cards`) are an API surface intended for external agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Antigravity) — they have no callers in this codebase and no automated tests proving they are exercised.

The `import sqlite3` convention is "primary access via `app/utils/db.py`". It is currently also imported by `app/memory/{manager,store,inspect}.py` (separate `medhub_memory.db`) and by `app/pages/{1_dashboard,2_estudo}.py` (known tech debt). CLIs under `Tools/` use `sqlite3` directly by design.

## How to run

Requirements: **Python 3.10+**, Ollama running locally with `nomic-embed-text` pulled (for RAG), ChromaDB installable.

```bash
# 1. Clone and create a virtualenv
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1                 # Windows PowerShell
# source .venv/bin/activate                  # macOS / Linux

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. (Optional) Configure environment
#    .env (gitignored) may set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for HyDE / LLM cards.
#    Absence triggers Ollama llama3 / heuristic fallback paths.

# 4. Initialise the SQLite store (must be run from repo root)
python Tools/init_db.py

# 5. (Optional) Pull the embedding model and index resumos for RAG
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
python Tools/index_resumos.py

# 6. Launch the app
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is the only env var consumed by the codebase. Other paths (`OLLAMA_URL`, `CHROMA_PATH=data/chroma`, `DB_PATH=ipub.db`, `medhub_memory.db`) are currently hardcoded.

The dashboard boots cleanly on a fresh, empty database created by `init_db.py`; it will display zero data until errors or sessions are recorded.

## Status and limitations

**What works**
- End-to-end loop: error CLI → SQLite → flashcard → FSRS scheduling → review in the Streamlit app.
- Local RAG over the markdown knowledge base via Ollama embeddings and ChromaDB.
- Multi-query retrieval with optional HyDE (Anthropic → Ollama → identity fallback chain).
- FSRS-inspired review flow with state in SQLite.
- Graceful degradation: app boots without `chromadb`, without Ollama, and without `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

**What is partial or known-fragile**
- BM25 hybrid rerank is implemented and dormant; re-enabling regressed retrieval on this corpus (see comment in `app/engine/rag.py`).
- No automated retrieval benchmark is committed. Numbers cited in internal docs are from informal manual evaluations and are not reproducible from this repo.
- The FSRS scheduler is a simplified single-formula implementation, not a faithful FSRS v4.
- Three of the five `app/engine/` exports (`analyze_error`, `get_review_queue`, `generate_contextual_cards`) have no in-repo callers and no tests; treat them as API surface, not tested integrations.
- `ipub.db` was tracked early on and removed via `git rm --cached`; the blob remains in git history. It is gitignored going forward.
- Historical commits also contain a transcribed UMED study schedule (`data/cronograma_umed.csv`) and the author's own EMED performance log (`Dashboard EMED 2026.xlsx`); both have been removed from the current tree.
- Test coverage is effectively zero (`Tools/test_memory.py` only); no `pytest.ini`, no CI.

**Out of scope**
- No multi-user, no auth, no deployment. Single-machine study environment.
